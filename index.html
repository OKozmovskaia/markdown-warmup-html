  <h3>A funny story</h3>
  <p>When my husband moved to Brussels, he advised me to learn [dʌʧ] lunguage . He didn’t elaborate, and I didn’t check it and started learning Danish instead of Dutch. Only after a month did we realize that I was learning the wrong language. Until now I have not yet taken up Danish.</p>
  <p>Moral: before moving to another country, check the languages spoken by the locals</p>
